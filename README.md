# Pair Programming: Word Search

This is an exercise from Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Program which focuses on pair-programming, test-driven development, and planning as part of a team.

## Description

The aim is to implement a word search solver, as a function that receives a 2D array of letters and a word. The function must:
* Check to find the word horizontally and vertically
* Return true if the word is found, and return false if the word is not found
